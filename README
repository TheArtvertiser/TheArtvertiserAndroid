To compile it you'll need to download the latest version of openFrameworks, 007
for android and follow the instructions to install it at:

http://openframeworks.cc/setup/android-eclipse

You'll also need the artvertiserCommons repository in:

http://github.com/arturoc/artvertiserCommons

and ofxHttpUtils which is included as a submodule.

This software is still a beta version.
